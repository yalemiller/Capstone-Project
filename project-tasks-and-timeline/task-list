## Tasks

- **Research climate change datasets** relevant to food, housing, and clothing impacts.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Specify the personal metrics** users can input (e.g., location, diet, clothing).  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Design the user input flow in Figma** for collecting personal data (location, age, diet, career).  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Develop backend data structures** to store and process user input.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Integrate climate prediction datasets** with visualization logic in D3.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Implement the visualization scrubber** so users can view changes over time by year.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Develop visual modules** showing impacts on food, living (housing/sea level), and clothing preferences.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Test usability** of mockups and prototypes through user interviews.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Validate accuracy** of visualizations against original dataset sources.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*

- **Document the entire system** (data sources, assumptions, design choices) in the final report.  
  *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
