### Learn about me and my work at www.yalemiller.com

I am a UX/UI Design specialist looking for a capstone project focused on creating a piece of software that either helps a specific user group address an everyday challenge or provides a meaningful data visualization. Some early concepts include:

**Your Brain on Climate Change (working title):** A web-based tool where users input details such as location, age, and occupation. The platform then projects how climate change may shape their lives in 25 years—for example, how rising sea levels could impact their home, which foods from their diet may no longer be available, and what percentage of their income may go toward adapting to climate-related challenges.

**GenBridge:** Originally prototyped during a hackathon, this app connects older and younger generations to foster friendships, combat loneliness, and encourage the exchange of skills. When paired, users define a shared goal (their “bridge”) to work on together over the course of a time period they define.
