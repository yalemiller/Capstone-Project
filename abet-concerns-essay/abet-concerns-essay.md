Designing a visualization tool that helps users understand how ecological change will personally impact them comes with a number of constraints that shape what the project can and cannot achieve.

## Ethical Considerations  
It is essential that climate data be presented in a way that **informs rather than manipulates**. Climate predictions can be emotionally charged, and there is a fine line between awareness and fear.  
My responsibility is to design a system that **empowers users with knowledge** instead of exploiting anxiety.

## Environmental Considerations  
The project must also consider **its own environmental footprint**.  
Hosting or processing large climate datasets can consume compute resources, so I must be mindful of:
- server usage  
- choice of data sources  
- sustainability of the infrastructure used  

The goal is to show environmental impacts **without unintentionally creating avoidable environmental costs**.

## Economic Considerations  
The project is constrained by the **limited resources** available to a student developer.  
I rely on:
- open data sources  
- free or educational licenses  
- limited development time  

These constraints shape the scope and fidelity of the tool, but they also encourage creative, resource-efficient solutions.

## Social Considerations  
The visualization must balance **personalization and inclusivity**.  
Climate change impacts users differently depending on:
- location  
- socioeconomic background  
- cultural context  

It is important not to assume a single “default” lifestyle. A truthful visualization must acknowledge that **climate change affects everyone, but not equally**.

---

Ultimately, each constraint—ethical, environmental, economic, and social—requires deliberate design choices. These factors shape not only how the project functions, but also **the type of impact it can have on users and on society**.
