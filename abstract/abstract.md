## Project Abstract  
Google “climate change” and you will see many sites claiming to calculate your *carbon footprint*. These visualizations show how you impact the environment, but none show how the environment impacts **you**.  

My Capstone project is a data visualization that illustrates how current climate projections will affect your eating, living, and clothing habits. Users will be able to select their lifestyle choices and see how these habits may be forced to evolve over time as the climate of our world changes.
