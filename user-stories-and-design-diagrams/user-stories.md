# Design Diagrams

**This project is a data visualization that shows how climate change will affect your own personal day to day life. In these three Design Diagrams, diamonds represent actions taken by the user, triangles represent actions taken by the software and the oval represents the goal/end state. Each arrow shows the next action taken once the previous action finishes. The user and the beginning of each flow is shown as a rectangle labeled with the name of the diagram.
