## Tasks

1. **Research** climate change datasets relevant to food, housing, and clothing impacts. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
2. **Specify** the three to five personal metrics users can input (e.g., location, diet, clothing). *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
3. **Design** the user input flow in Figma for collecting personal data (location, age, diet, career). *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
4. **Develop** backend data structures and API endpoints to store and process user input. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
5. **Integrate** climate prediction datasets with visualization logic in D3/React. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
6. **Implement** the visualization scrubber so users can view changes over time by year (10/20/50-year views). *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
7. **Develop** visual modules showing impacts on food, housing (including sea-level effects), and clothing preferences. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
8. **Test** usability of mockups and prototypes through user interviews and iteration. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
9. **Validate** accuracy of visualizations against original dataset sources and document assumptions. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
10. **Document** the system, data sources, design decisions, and testing results in the final report. *(Assigned: Yale Miller)*
