# Project Description

The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive data visualization tool that helps users understand how ecological and climate changes will directly impact their personal lifestyles over time. Unlike traditional “carbon footprint” tools that focus on how individuals affect the environment, this project reverses the perspective: it shows how the environment will affect them.

Users will input a set of personal characteristics—such as location, diet, living situation, and clothing habits—and the system will use scientific climate projection datasets to generate personalized, time-based visualizations. These visuals will depict how rising temperatures, shifting agricultural zones, sea-level changes, and ecosystem disruptions might influence everyday choices such as:

- what foods remain available,  
- how clothing needs evolve, and  
- whether their region or housing may face environmental risks.

## Core Visualization Modules

### **Food & Agriculture**
Estimates changes in diet availability based on crop viability, regional temperature shifts, and long-term climate trends.

### **Living & Housing**
Shows environmental risk factors including flooding, extreme heat, and resource constraints associated with different geographical regions.

### **Clothing & Consumption Habits**
Illustrates how rising temperatures or shifting seasons may affect wardrobe needs and consumption patterns.

## Interaction & Design

A **time-scrubber control** allows users to browse projections year by year, offering a clear comparison between near-future and long-term impacts.

The interface is currently being designed in **Figma** with an emphasis on clarity, personalization, accessibility, and ethical communication of scientific data. The final implementation will use **D3.js** to render interactive, dynamic visual modules based on open-source climate datasets.

Ultimately, this tool aims to empower users by showing how environmental change intersects with personal lifestyle choices, encouraging adaptation, resilience, and informed decision-making.
